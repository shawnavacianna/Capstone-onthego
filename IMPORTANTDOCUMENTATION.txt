We need to change the file path for all the folders outside of the HTML&PHP folder.

That is , all filepaths must change to

../../.c9/insert relevant folder names

For the files in the HTML&PHP folder the link format is changed from:

/.c9/css/firstpage.css

to 

.c9/css/firstpage.css

See frontpage.html


This is the sample of the file we will use to call our index.html from our 
<?php
        include(".c9/HTML&PHP/index.html");
?>



commands on server

wq - write quit after insert
i to insert
esc to go to command mode
vi to edit the file
cd .. - to go back one folder
q! quit without saving
cp -R to copy with folders
cp to copy files
rm -R for removing directories
q to quit 

Workflow

vi - > i -> esc -> wq /q/ q!
